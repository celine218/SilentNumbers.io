<p>“Hello? Is this working? No, Ellie, I think I figured it out. I don’t need your help. I got it! Okay, hello! This is log one, my name is Dr. Jennifer Lilywise, and today’s date is November twenty-fifth, twenty-forty. Wow, I can’t believe today is the big day! We just settled into our new place, and Brian finished hanging up the last couple of frames. Here we are in our new home, sweet home!</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness, this program took a lot of legal work and persuading, but it was all worth it. I just hope this goes somewhere good, oh who am I kidding! Everything will be ok.</p>
<p>“I’m not exactly sure what's going on with the virus situation though, we lost track of Coroz a couple of months ago. I’m sure we’ll get it settled out; as long as we keep this under the radar, we should be alright. Let’s just hope he doesn't start jumping too often.</p>
<p>“I can’t be focusing on that when we have some significant events coming up! What I’m most excited about is that we were finally about to replicate and improve the 109 chip, as well as other hardware, so Project C.H.I should run smoothly. Once we finish giving the rest of the students their chips and everyone accepts the update, we can open the program for even more newcomers.</p>
<p>“We are also hoping to wake Jada in the near future, which, I’d like to say here for the record that, yes, I do feel guilty for keeping her asleep for as long as I did. I had to do it, though. If she were awake, she would never let us use her chip. We couldn’t risk her running off with it, but hopefully, she doesn't figure it out. She might even join the campus! No, probably not; that should be considered a miracle.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning, so this is goodbye for now! Dr. Lilywise, ok, I’ll say it, and Dr. Malva is signing off!”</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>I gasp awake to a pearl white tile ceiling above my head; the burning stench of alcohol sends me into a state of panic. I don’t know if I’m back in the facility; the room is too dim to see anything. I jump upright, grab the earpiece of the tester, and rip it off my ear. When I reach for the needle, a hand grabs me by the arm while another holds my torso down to the bed, the soft mattress pushing it deeper into my back.</p>
<p>“I need some help here!” Two more nurses rush into the room to hold down my legs and head. “You’re alright, Miss Juarez. Just breathe.” The young nurse's eyes are calm; I’ve never seen this person in my life. They keep shushing me, gently running their hand over my head. My joints stop straining, and the other two nurses let go of my body.</p>
<p>The hospital room is small; a curtain creates a wall between my roommate on the other bed and I. They’re snoring rather boisterously; the electronic clock on the table next to me reads “December 25th, 2040,” with the time “7:45” underneath it. A nurse walks over to the curtains of the window and pulls them open.</p>
<p>The room turns to a soft orange with hints of the sun’s yellow rays. Shadows of the forest’s trees decorate the room, the snow laying on them causing pouches of soft orange clouds. Snowflakes gently fall past the window; the view from the high floor displays a couple of small buildings before more pearly, white Oregon trees in the distance; the city lights slowly blink on as the night begins.</p>
<p>As the sun is swallowed by the hills, the orange evaporates as the snow makes the dusk sky a beautiful periwinkle blue.</p>
<p>The glass window intensifies the coldness in the room. The thin hospital gown is not too warm. I twist the delicate bedsheets around me, shivering as I struggle to keep warm.</p>
<p>The kind nurse lays a heavy blanket on me; they give me a soft smile that reassures me. I’m safe. I’m out. If only I could enjoy this moment with Imelda. I wait for her buzzing to return, some sort of thought to appear, but nothing comes to me. Imelda’s gone, but I’m not. I’ll stay and finish what’s begun.</p>
<p>The nurse checks the file beside my bed, leans closer, and says, “Welcome back, Jada.”</p>
