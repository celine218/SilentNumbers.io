   <img src = "images/Differenciate.png" class="animted zoomIn center">
   <p>The fumes filling the room create a thick blanket over my eyes, and the disorientation from Lily’s punch is not helping. Lily’s punch? No, this is Malva’s punch? I think? Shit, my nose fills with some sort of liquid, as though I took a big sniff underwater. I’m pretty sure she broke it. Lily, what did you do?!</p>
   <p>I didn’t want to believe it was true. Malva being able to overpower Lily should not have been a question of “if” but “when.” I was too scared to lose Lily in her decision that I ignored the red flags from when she was asleep. It seems obvious that she was trying to hold down Malva with all those kicks and cries.</p>
   <p>“Now is not time for thinking about what we should have done,” Imelda thinks. “We need to get out of here.”</p>
   <p>Imelda’s right. At least I didn’t leave earlier; now, I need to save everyone from the fire.</p>
   <p>Malva’s grin pierces through Lily’s soft face. I need to get a hold of myself, somehow get Malva out without hurting Lily. But how am I going to do that when I’m leaning against a wall barely able to breathe or see, and she probably wants to fight again. My irritated eyes try to search for her in the fumes. The lime green of her shirt flashes around, but every time I blink, I lose her again. Her haunting laughter gets closer every second.</p>
   <p>A fist flies out of the smoke in the corner of my eye, jabbing me again on the jaw. Slamming against the burning concrete floor, I try to recover, but Lily sits on my stomach, crushing my organs. Punch after punch, and I can’t see through my bruised eye anymore. I need to do something! Anything! The muscles in my face ache and pull in every direction, and my brain beats against the concrete. The tears that try to moisturize my eyes aren’t helping; they dry up before they can even fall out. I can't breathe from my nose; it’s clogged from blood clots, stinging like hell. On top of everything, I can't catch a breath from my throat either without wheezing through my cut, dried-out lips. The deep and moist coughs toss out the clots from my nose that have fallen down my throat.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Jada, why did you trust her?" Malva bellows. "Well? After she lied to your face, and after you know what she did to you. Do you really think she’s innocent? You were so gullible for her sweet, little heart. Now she thinks she can use me and take the credit for my work? I don’t think so!”</p>
   <p>Don’t listen. Malva is just trying to get into my head. I can’t trust this psycho. I shouldn’t. Should I be listening? No, she’s just lying to me. Right, Imelda?</p>
   <p>My mind goes blank. Imelda, I shouldn’t trust a word she says, right? She can’t be telling the truth. No, Lily would never lie to us like that. She wouldn’t trick us, right? Still no response. It’s not that she’s not there. She’s just refusing to give me an answer.</p>
   <p>It doesn’t matter right now. Does it? No, it doesn’t. I need to find something to do. Her coughs and wheeze indicate that she’s getting light-headed too. One significant hit will get her down, but I wouldn’t be hurting Malva. It would still be Lily’s body. Plus, I don’t think a standard punch would get her head beaten enough that she would give me a fighting chance.</p>
   <p>“All she tells are fucking lies, and you know it! I heard it all! All the lies about the kidnapping, the lies of how I apparently was the only one who went berserk. Oh! I love how she covers up the shit she has done to Coroz and I like it never even happened. I heard it all and laughed while you just ate it all up!” Malva lands a blow that makes my head twist to the right.</p>
   <p>The doorknob from Lily’s room catches my eye. If I hit her with that, it will be enough to take her out. But, I will take them out, both Malva and Lily. I won’t be hitting Malva on the head, but instead, I’ll be smashing Lily’s head. She doesn't deserve that; she’s done everything she could to protect me and all of us. Lily’s been put through enough as it is, and I don’t want to hurt her unnecessarily. Right, Imelda? She’s a good guy, right? Still no response from her. Why won’t she answer me?!</p>
   <p>“Do you hear me, Jada!?” Malva screams in my face, holding my tank top in her fist. The heat of her breath incinerates my face, and the blood gushing from my nose burns from the warmth. She coughs and wheezes into every hole in my face as she continues spewing her anger. “You helped her kill me. Now I’m going to repay the favor.” She takes a kitchen knife from her pocket, pointing it against my throat.</p>
   <p>I try to reach for the knob barely within reach and roll it into my hand. It burns the tips of my finger, but I resist pulling away not to alert them of my plan. This will burn my entire hand if I grab it, but it will hurt Lily more if I go through with this. I can’t see Malva as the one who’s beating me. Instead, I see Lily being forced to do her bidding, being tossed around like a rag doll. I need to hit her over the head with the knob because I don’t have a lot of choices besides laying here and dying. I know Lily is in there somewhere, but I’m in no control to be able to pull her out. Wait, I remember what Lily told me.</p>
   <p>“If she ever takes control of my body, punch me, beat me with a bat, shoot me if you need to. I don't care.”</p>
   <p>I need to get those people out. I made a promise to her that I would. They don’t deserve to burn to death after everything we’ve been through, especially that child. Oh god, if I don’t get out, that child will die. I can’t let that happen. I’m the only one who can save her; if I die here, so will she. I just hope that Lily will forgive me for this. She’ll understand.</p>
   <p>I keep eye contact with them and grip the knob. The searing of my skin goes cold for a moment before it begins to tear through the layers of flesh.</p>
   <p>“You know what?” Malva coughs into my face, pushing the knife closer to my neck, “If I’m going down, I’m taking this entire damn ship with me!”</p>
   <p>I lift it up, and in one quick swing, the ball hits Lily right on the temple of her head. She falls to my side, completely knocked out from the blow. In one big push, I slide her body off of me and kick the knife to the other side of the room. There’s no blood on the side of her head, so I hope she’s just unconscious.</p>
   <p>The blistering red circle in the middle of my hand and inside my fingers begins to pinch with the sting of the burn, but I can't get caught up in this simple pain right now. I need to get out of here! No, I need to get to that floor. The one Lily told me where everyone is. I need to go back to the detention floor.</p>
   <p>As I begin to run towards the elevator, I turn back to see Lily’s unconscious body in the middle of the room. I hate Malva with my whole heart, but I can’t leave Lily behind. It doesn’t matter what she’s trying to hide down here or what Imelda is forcing herself not to tell me, she’s helped me to the best of her ability, and I can’t abandon her here. I try to lift Lily’s unconscious body, but the fatigue from the smoke makes her as heavy as cement. There’s no way I’ll pick her up; instead, I grab her two arms and, with short bursts of energy, tug her body across the floor and drag her towards the elevator door. I slap the button and hold the door open with my foot as I continue to push and pull her body across the burning floor. Stairs would probably be safer in the long run, but I can’t waste time looking for them. I need to work with what I have.</p>
   <p>The air in here is a bit cleaner, but the fumes still find their way in. I stumble to take the green-painted key out of my pocket and insert it into the elevator. My finger repeatedly spams the elevator shut, keeping the air just a bit cleaner. The rest of the buttons begin to glow. Which one was it to go to release them? I think it was five?</p>
   <p>“Six is detention, and eight holds Coroz,” Imelda finally returns. I thought something had happened to her, but she only feels rushed by the fire engulfing the facility. She’s been here the entire time, and now he finally responds to a question? Now is not the time to be mysterious and hold secrets. It’s time to work together so we can finally get out and return to our lives. As I reach for the button for the sixth floor, a sudden hesitation makes me second guess. “Go to floor seven,” thinks Imelda.</p>
   <p>Why?</p>
   <p>“If we go to floor six, you’ll run around with no clue where you need to be,” Imelda thinks, “Floor seven has cameras. Maybe we can get a better idea of where to go from there.”</p>
   <p>Good idea. Now is not the time to be flying blind.</p>
   <p>I shift my finger over to floor seven and slowly plummet back into hell.</p>
   <p>The elevator twitches with every inch it moves. Are the cables beginning to give in? If they are, this escape route will not last too long; so I need to work fast. I leave the key for the elevator inside the slot, don’t want to risk losing it in the rubble of collapsing rooms. Then, I place the rest of the keys between my fingers to add blades to my knuckles.</p>
   <p>I have been as docile as I could be for a good amount of my stay, but I’ve learned that can only get me so far. I said I wanted to leave here without blood on my hands, but the truth is that’s exactly what I needed to escape. The only reason why I’m alive is because the times I’ve fought gave me windows of opportunities, and the times I didn’t others did it for me. Stabbing Malva’s foot and crushing her hand was necessary. It allowed me to make it as far as I am now. Coroz’s threats put him in a position of power over the two of us in the chip, so I need to give that same energy back. If I need to fight, I’ll fight with the intention to leave them unable to chase me. That’s what I did wrong in the lab with Malva. I won’t kill, but I will live.</p>
   <p>I’m sorry, Lily, if you return as Malva, I can’t promise I won’t hurt you again. I also know there's the probability that I could run into Coroz within these halls. If he could get a tester from Malva, who knows what else he can do? I’m a target on his kill list too, so if he even tries to get near me, I won't resist plunging these into his chest.</p>
   <p>“Floor seven” screeches the leftovers of the elevator’s voice. I have to leave Lily in the shaft; as I don’t have the energy to be able to carry her with me. The metal screeches open to reveal a smokey security room of monitors displaying cameras on the eighth floor. This floor has joined the collective fire, and the smoke from the floors above is seeping in. I place the swivel chair between the elevator door to ensure it doesn't leave without me. There must be at least twenty monitors flashing in different rooms and parts of the halls. The screams echo through the speakers, some people begging for their lives in the flaming cells while others are on their knees doing different types of prayers.</p>
   <p>I look around the room for something to tell me where to go. Something to let me know where people are. Below the monitors, there’s a table with a lone wireless keyboard and a clipboard. Attached to the clipboard is a piece of printed paper with a table labeled with three columns: Name, Number, Room.</p>
   <p>Under Name, it lists out from top to bottom: Liam, Michael, Jamie, Mary, Alaya, Dallas, Annie, Jada, Imelda, and Coroz. The rows with the names Dallas and Imelda are crossed out. The names Jada, Annie, and Coroz are highlighted in purple.</p>
   <p>Under Number, it lists out from top to bottom: LI307, MI207, JA308, MA208, AL108, N/A, AN309, JA109, IM109, and CO209.</p>
   <p>I’m guessing these are the labels for our chips, in which it would make sense that Dallas wouldn’t have anything since he was shot before the operation. I must be reading this wrong. The beginning is the first two letters of our name, and the number represents the chip inserted into our heads during the surgery. I remember that from the chips I saw in the lab. Then, how in the world could Imelda and I share the same chip number? Unless we share the same chip.</p>
   <p>In a sudden gasp, the clearest memory I have ever seen from Imelda replays in my head.  I watch as Lily gets shoved into a cell by Malva, and Imelda tries to make her escape. With no elevator key in hand, Imelda runs toward her final mission. My heart pounds as fast as she sprints, not for her life, but for the rest of the chips. With a sharp right turn and an even sharper left turn, Imelda busts into the compact lab. Malva’s heels violently clap against the ground as they get closer and closer, causing Imelda’s hands to tremble in panic. With violent tugs, the lab drawers clash their way open as she hunts for the chips. Her heart skips a beat as she opens a drawer to find the supply of chips. The small devices pile in her hands as fast as she can grab them, but as she raises her arm to smash them on the floor, the lab’s door swings open.</p>
   <p>Bang!</p>
   <p>With one fatal shot, Malva pierces a bullet straight through Imelda’s chest.</p>
   <p>Bang!</p>
   <p>A second shot rings out, the bottom half of my face goes numb to avoid the memory of her jaw meeting a bullet. The chips clatter against the ground as Imelda wheezes for mercy, covering her blood-soaked shirt. As she stumbles, two more shots ring out as two sharp burns pierce through my torso. With a loud thud, she falls back and lets her head smack against the lab’s floor.</p>
   <p>This memory was recognizable, as I got glimpses of it from when I was actually in the lab. What proceeded next was completely foreign.</p>
   <p>With blurry vision, she watches the ceiling shift as someone grabs her by the legs and drags her out of the room. The memory gaps demonstrate her getting dragged down a hall, put into an elevator, then placed on an operating table. Imelda suddenly notices the belts strapped across her bleeding torso, but she is too weak to struggle, as she lost most of her blood on the way here. An ice-cold knife pierces Imelda’s head, slicing through every nerve in the skin on her skull.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?!” Imelda gasped as the blood from the underside of her skin dripped down her sides. The bleeding from her lungs overwhelmed her speaking ability, and blood filled her throat like a river, spilling out with every cough.  A bone saw buzzed beyond her vision as Malva gripped, “I’m not going let you go to waste.”</p>
   <p>Imelda has a decently clear understanding of how this facility worked, technology and all, but this was something that she could have never suspected. All possible scenarios as to what Malva was attempting to do ran through her head at once, but that deep primal fear of the unknown blurred her judgment to where all thoughts just became noise. It was a flashing realization of all the noise coming together that made her realize what was going on.</p>
   <p>The sound of the saw tearing at her skull traveled through her head and out her ears. The blinding operation room lights made her vision white as more and more of her skull came apart in chunks. With a moist squish, Malva’s long nails made their way into the crevices of Imelda’s brain. Imelda knew at that moment that Malva was trying to retrieve her chip.</p>
   <p>“There you are,” Malva gleamed. With a quick tug, something disconnected from within Imelda’s brain.</p>
   <p>In the blink of an eye, Imelda gasps alive inside the chip. No longer the host of her own body, she sat up in the infinite plane, baffled by what just happened. She ran through her memories to see how she could have possibly arrived here. Upon connecting the dots, she let the grief flow over her knowing that she was dead. Imelda stood up, unknowing as to what she was, and screamed into the infinite abyss. Maybe in hopes that someone would come and save her? No, this was a scream of defeat.</p>
   <p>The first couple screams she begged for it not to be true, trying to tell herself that there was no way that it ended like this. The second wave of screams was in anger, as she pounded her fist into the ground cursing every name on her mind: Coroz, Malva…and Lily. Imelda then sat down, not so much screaming but yelling into the void for some sort of explanation. Was she just here temporarily until she awakes? There’s got to be some way for her to come back. Her life flashes before her eyes, as she reflects everything that’s going to be left behind. Unknowing of what’s coming next in this new form of un-dead life, she weeps in the thought of what she knew for certain. The people she may never see again and the moments she will never live.</p>
   <p>This cycle continued time and time again until the memory jumps into me awakening after the surgery. The memory plays through my eyes, but I feel it through Imelda’s consciousness. She watches the movie of me, terrified as I stumble around the cell. Although she couldn’t control it, some part of her was relieved in knowing that this wasn’t exactly a for-sure end. She didn’t know everything but Imelda knew that there was something to be done here. As she “meets” me for the first time, it also sparked the beginning of some sort of acceptance.</p>
   <p>Many parts of her were missing as she was nothing more than memories and a consciousness transferred into ones and zeros. A fate worse than death. All that was left of her were a bunch of silent numbers.</p>
   <p>I pull myself out of the flashback and back to reality. It all makes sense now. That’s why Imelda isn’t a complete person in the chip, but a faded consciousness barely strung together. She never needed to transfer. Someone took her chip out of her head and put it into mine. I see the leftovers of her consciousness, a literal dead woman walking. My stomach turns inside out thinking about it. Imelda’s memory flows into me with disgust. They didn’t know she was still there, so they put it in me, thinking I wouldn’t notice.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry you had to find out like this,” Imelda thinks.</p>
   <p>No, I’m sorry you suffered such a terrible fate. You’ve put all of your efforts into saving me because you didn’t want me to end up the same way. I don’t think I could ever thank you enough for just existing. Despite your pain and suffering, you’ve always been in my corner. Even when I didn’t notice, you still helped. I’ll get us out not only for me but for you too.</p>
   <p>A single tear drops from my eye from Imelda as she appears in the corner of my eyes with tears of joy.</p>
   <p>The smoke makes me cough and wheeze. I was so caught up in this realization that I didn’t notice how much worse the air quality got. I just need to find the cell numbers, and I’ll be out of here. As I look into the cameras, I notice the floor with the locked doors has a number hanging above them. I look down at the paper and look for where everyone is.</p>
   <p>Under Cell, it lists out from top to bottom: #5, #1, #3, #4, #6, #2, #2, #7, #7, N/A.</p>
   <p>Annie is on the opposite side of the hall, so I need to get there quickly.</p>
   <p>“Jada?” I hear Lily mumble, standing up in the elevator. Is that Lily? I can't risk another fight with Malva. There are still people out there who need my help. I march towards the elevator, clenching the keys in my fist. With a swift kick, I launch the chair out of the elevator. I slam the button for the eighth floor and push Lily against the wall. My arm reclines back, keys aiming for her throat just in case she tries to pick another fight with me.</p>
   <p>“Jada, wait!” she screams, placing her arms in the air. “I’m sorry, please, I’m sorry! I-I-I shouldn’t have lied I…!” Lily’s accent has returned. She stares at me with the same eyes she gave Malva. What am I thinking? Have I really turned this ruthless? No, stop second-guessing. I need to stand my ground. “Please don’t hurt me,” she stumbles. “I’m sorry!”</p>
   <p>I let go of her and sign, “I need help letting them out.”</p>
   <p>“Oh...oh my goodness, I-I-I don’t know how to help I-” she stutters.</p>
   <p>I take the keys out of my fist and shake them in front of her, asking, “Annie’s?”</p>
   <p>“R-right,” she stumbles, looking through the keys and grabbing one away from the others. “This one!”</p>
   <p>I snatch it from her hands and take that key off the ring. “You take the others up. I’ll get Annie out.”</p>
   <p>Still disoriented from her nap, Lily looks at the keys in disbelief. “I-I don’t know. What if Malva comes back?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll take care of her,” I sign, putting the key between my fingers and creating a fist. Lily's jaw drops, feeling the side of her head. She understands what I’m willing to do to keep Malva at bay. It’s a hard pill to swallow but a necessity.</p>
   <p>“B-before Ellie was able to take over,” she stammers, “I-I was able to call the authorities. They’re on their way.” she glares down at the hand which I burned with the doorknob “-And what happened to your hand?! Golly, you could have –.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about me,” I sign. “You need to lead them out. Can you bring them to the elevator?”</p>
   <p>“I’m afraid not, my dear,” The elevator trembles and crumbles. “It seems like it’s about to collapse with only our weight. I don’t believe a group of panicking people would be willing to stay under the weight limit. But, I can show them to the staircase. What about you? What are you going to do?”</p>
   <p>“I’m going to Annie directly,” I sign.</p>
   <p>“Alright, will I meet you back here?”</p>
   <p>“Yes.”</p>
   <p>“Please, please don’t take too long.” The elevator drops a bit, the cables cracking echoing in the compact chamber. “The cables will not hold on for much longer. So, please just be quick and come back to me.”</p>
   <p>“I will...I promise I’ll return.”</p>
   <p>The elevator’s broken speaker screams “Floor eight” in a demonic voice as the doors tremble their way open. Lily and I run through the hall, trying not to step on the burning ceiling tiles that fell as we navigate through the labyrinth. We both bash open the door before us and pause to take in the disaster.</p>
   <p>The place is crumbling, chunks of the tiled ceiling are dropping in flames, and I’ve never seen so much smoke. With my fingers tightly wrapped around the key, I sprint out; Lily suddenly screams, “Wait!”</p>
   <p>She takes off her lab coat, wrapping the thick material around my nose and mouth; she coughs, “You’re going to need this a lot more than me.” I reach in for a hug, but Lily takes a step back in hesitation. She gives me a light smile and wheezes, “Now go save her!”</p>
   <p>I run back the way I came; Lily follows close behind.</p>
   <p>“Look out!” Lily yells.</p>
   <p>Cr-ack!</p>
   <p>I jump to my side as a tile falls where I stood, and the roof collapses on one of the cells. The cries from within fall to a sudden silence, and I turn my eyes away from the scene. I don’t dare to find out what happened to that person. I need to get to Annie before her cell collapses too.</p>
   <p>As I get closer to the door, a high-pitched scream becomes more and more prominent. My bare feet scratch against the burning floor even faster. I need to get to her in time. Please, let me get there in time.</p>
   <p>I reach cell number two, my quavering hand continuously missing the keyhole.</p>
   <p>“Breathe, Jada,” Imelda thinks. “You got this kiddo.” I grab the handlebar to ground myself and finally get it in. With a quick swing, I meet eyes with Annie.</p>
   <p>“Please! Please help me!” she whales out. I gasp, noticing that half of the roof had already collapsed on top of her. The lower half of her petite body is crushed by the immense weight of the roof as blood seeps out from under the rubble. She continues to cry out in pain, moving whatever part of her body she can in an attempt to get out.</p>
   <p>“She’s not going to be able to run,” Imelda thinks.</p>
   <p>That’s fine. I’ll carry her.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have the strength or energy for that.”</p>
   <p>I’ll do my best to try at least.</p>
   <p>“How are you planning on getting her out?”</p>
   <p>I don’t know. I’ll do whatever it takes.</p>
   <p>I run into the flaming room, but something odd catches my attention. A portion of her thick hair is much shorter than the rest, and it’s not subtle. No, this is a good portion on the back of her head, leaving a concave in her coils.</p>
   <p>“Check for operation scars,” Imelda commands.</p>
   <p>What? Lily said she never operated on her. Are you implying that she’s lying to us?</p>
   <p>“Kid, just check.”</p>
   <p>I pull apart the hair, revealing operation scars. No. No, this can’t be. Was Lily lying to me? No, maybe this was Malva’s doing.</p>
   <p>“Series get their operations all done at once. Which series is she a part of?”</p>
   <p>I look down at her tattoo with a gasp, “AN309”, the last of my series. She’s successful too.</p>
   <p>“Lady, what are you doing?” Annie cries out.</p>
   <p>I’m wasting time questioning; I just need to get her out. I try to get ahold of the bottom of the rubble, the metal searing my skin.</p>
   <p>“Please help! I’m scared!”  she cries out. I gently lay a hand on her cheek, nodding yes.</p>
   <p>I shake the idea of the pain out of my head, firmly grasping a chunk of the rubble. The metal bar burns my already blistered hand again, but I don’t flinch. Endure the pain. Your hands will be fine. It’s just a burn. I need to save her. The burning of the metal tears through my flesh, stinging every nerve in my hand. That’s ok. I just need to lift it a little bit so she can move.</p>
   <p>My back begins to curve under the immense pressure; the strain in my legs is about to snap my hamstring in half. I don’t care. I just need to move it a bit.</p>
   <p>“Kid, stop,” Imelda thinks, “You’re going to pull something.”</p>
   <p>I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care! I will get her out! My back muscles pull so tight that they, too, might just snap, but I need to keep going.</p>
   <p>The rubble hasn’t moved an inch. Maybe I’m not putting enough pressure.</p>
   <p>“Ow!” Annie screams, “It hurts!”</p>
   <p>I pull as hard as I can, shaking the rubble to somewhat loosen it.</p>
   <p>Crack!</p>
   <p>I see the other half of the roof deteriorating right above. This rubble needs to move faster, or the roof will collapse on both of us. As much as I pull it, it won’t budge.</p>
   <p>“You need to leave,” Imelda commands.</p>
   <p>No. No, I’m not leaving Annie behind. You said it yourself that she needs to be saved. She can’t be another death. I can do it!</p>
   <p>I look within the rubble and see her legs, mangled and contorted in every direction.</p>
   <p>Snap!</p>
   <p>Another bone snaps as the rubble shifts and adds more pressure. Annie shrieks in pain as her crying gets louder.</p>
   <p>Please, she can’t die like this. This is no way to go. I can save her!</p>
   <p>A sharp pain stabs my back as the muscle recoils and tears into a ball. With a screech, I fall to the floor, the muscles pulsating and straining as the nerve pain shoots to my shoulders and neck. I pulled my back. No! No, I can’t. How can I get her out? Think!</p>
   <p>Cra-ck!</p>
   <p>The roof above me is about to collapse. I can barely move, nonetheless, move the rubble. Imelda was right. My back is screwed, and I need to get out of here.</p>
   <p>I stumble out of the cell, hearing her cry, “No! Please don’t leave me! Lady, please! Lady!”</p>
   <p>With one final stumble, the room behind me collapses. Tears fall down my face as I watch the blood seep from under the mess.</p>
   <p>No. God, please don't tell me. Annie! Her cold hazel eyes stare me down through the rubble with fresh tears still falling. I understand now. That was what she had, that emotion I couldn’t place my hand on it. Her innocent eyes were dead.</p>
   <p>Smacking my torn body on the wreckage, I try to pull my way back in. She can’t be dead. The excruciating pain from my back fibers ripping apart forces me to collapse on top of the rubble. Please, let me save her. I’m not too late. I can’t be too late.</p>
   <p>“Leave her,” Imelda thinks, “You need to get out before the hall collapses too.”</p>
   <p>Lily’s lab coat falls off my face with the pressure of my jaw dropping open. Something inside me finally boils over. My beaten and bruised knuckles pound against the wall of wreckage as I scream with all my regrets, “No!” A second guttural scream pushes its way out of my lungs, leaving me breathless and gasping as I fall into a deep sob.</p>
   <p>She didn’t want to die, and I didn’t save her. God, what did I do wrong? She’s dead because of me. More screams fill the hall. I can’t get up. I killed her. I could have been there, but I wasn’t. She didn’t deserve this. Dying scared and mangled should never have been her fate.</p>
   <p>I don’t deserve to get out. I look down the hall, seeing the other cell doors open in the distance. Everyone must have got out by now. I’ll just be one more number to the death count. The outside world considers me dead, my funeral was probably already hosted, and there would be no purpose for me to go back out there. So if I die here, if I go with her, then nothing would change. I can’t leave her like this. I can’t leave.</p>
   <p>Imelda’s hand appears on my shoulder, “Kid,” she says in my ear in a comforting smooth voice. But it’s no use.</p>
   <p>I want to be here with her. I don’t want to leave her alone again. I deserve this. I killed her.</p>
   <p>“Kiddo, you know that’s not true,” Imelda’s voice speaks into my ear.</p>
   <p>My lungs begin to choke and gag with the smoke. It’s getting harder to breathe without Lily’s coat. I take it off of my neck and throw it on the ground. Is this why I was kept alive after everything? So that I can stuffer one more time? Seems fair. The harder it gets to breathe, the more I contemplate this. I should stay, shouldn’t I?</p>
   <p>“You have people waiting for you. Lily is waiting for you. You can’t leave it all behind.”</p>
   <p>As much as I hate to admit it, Imelda’s right. Lily’s waiting for me. If I stayed, Lily would run deeper into the hall for me. She would risk her life for me, at least I hope she would. It would just lead to more death, more misery. I want to see my parents and my sister again and say goodbye if I can. Or maybe even say hello again. I’m sorry, Annie, but I can’t stay.</p>
   <p>Trying to breathe again, I wrap Lily’s coat around my face. I’m still light-headed, but I can somewhat catch my breath through the thin layer of filtration. I leave her tomb, stumbling down the hall with a torn back.</p>
   <p>I killed her. I can’t believe I killed her.</p>
   <p>Wait. Imelda’s right. I didn’t kill her. Malva and Coroz did. They were the ones who brought her here in the first place. Coroz, he’s still alive. Malva may have paid for her deeds, but Coroz? Something else inside me snaps, and a boiling rage flows through my veins. A hatred, a wave of anger, I’ve never felt before. That bastard! I can’t leave here until I know he’s paid for what he’s done.</p>
   <p>I stumble towards the elevator, the rage from Annie’s death still broiling within me. I meet Lily at the end of the hall. She waves at me to hurry, but I’m already going as fast as I can. “Everyone’s out! We need to go!” she says.</p>
   <p>I ignore her remarks, step into the elevator, and hit the button for the sixth floor.</p>
   <p>Lily steps in, shocked at the option I chose. “J-Jada? That’s not the surface,” she remarks. I ignore her comment. The closer we get, the harder I breathe under her coat. The more pressure builds upon my fist, giving me pale knuckles. Lily takes notice and shutters, “J-Jada?”</p>
   <p>Her joy fades away as she notices the tears streaming down my numb expression. “Jada, where’s the child?” The panic-induced adrenaline keeps me paralyzed in my stance, trying not to release the time bomb inside of me ticking down. I don’t have the heart to tell her without going into a raging fit. I keep my eyes on the door, unable to look at Lily as she stares me down. She shakes me by the shoulder, “Please, don’t tell me.” Her smile strains to stay on, but it's the last effort to resist the truth. It fades away as she shakes me violently, “Annie. She’s alright, right?”</p>
   <p>Lily knows already, but the truth is too much for her to bear. Her head leans on my shoulder as she tries to hold back tears, and I swiftly shove her off. She better not touch me again. I’m already on edge as it is.</p>
   <p>“Jada, I’m so sorry. Please, don’t think any of this is your fault, ok? Whatever you are thinking of doing, we do not have the time.” I look at her motherly eyes. She holds my face in her tiny hands. “Please. You did your best to save as many people as you could. She wasn’t your fault.”</p>
   <p>“Floor six,” the elevator screeches with its leftover cords.</p>
   <p>Lily tries to grab ahold of my arm, but I yank her off. I quickly sign, “No more than five minutes.”</p>
   <p>I march my way down the burning hall, each step stronger than the last. The searing pain in my back only fuels my vexation.</p>
   <p>“Don’t do it,” Imelda thinks.</p>
   <p>Why not? This place is crumbling by the second. He’ll be burned beyond recognition before anyone notices.</p>
   <p>“That’s exactly why. I have helped you make it this far, and I’m not going to let you die in a fire because of a grudge.”</p>
   <p>It will be five minutes. The elevator was going to pass this floor, so why not take my chance?</p>
   <p>“He could kill you if he’s not restrained.”</p>
   <p>I’ll take my chances. I look down to find the pair of scissors I had dropped during my chase with Malva. They fit perfectly in my hands as I make a straight line for his cell.</p>
   <p>Imelda goes quiet, her anxieties lying in the back of my mind. I know exactly where I’m going, following the whistle of his stupid little tune. I turn to face the door, making eye contact with Coroz through the window.</p>
   <p>The door slams onto the wall with a swift swing and causes a couple more tiles to fall around Coroz. The flames that rage inside me turn into a forest fire. Coroz’s messy shirt lays on the floor on the other side of the room, and his hand is zip-tied to the bed frame. I guess Malva went back to make sure he wouldn’t run off either. Next to the bed lies his Rubik’s cube. It’s fully solved. The tester he stole from Malva is crookedly inserted into his back, barely over the many scars that ran alongside his spine. The roof above him is cracking and deteriorating, it’s going to fall on him, yet he’s still calm. He makes eye contact with me, and his mouth curls into another smirk.</p>
   <p>“Well, well, well, did ya’ come all this way for pretty ol’ me?”</p>
   <p>There he goes again with his stupid happy-go-lucky attitude.</p>
   <p>“Do ya’ want more info about somethin’?” Coroz’s face goes pale, noticing the scissors in my hand. I slowly make my way over to him with my crooked back, and for once, Coroz’s smile turns into nervosity. “H-hey. Are those for me? I-I think-” he giggles with nervosity.</p>
   <p>In a burst of rage, I sprint at him and plunge the scissors directly into the middle of his chest. Coroz screams in agony, gasping for air as I dig deeper and deeper into his chest. With all of my might, the scissors grind side to side so I can hear his screams and cries throughout the halls that once haunted me. Feeling his flesh rip under my blade causes the fire inside me to burn like never before. Tears stream down my face as I jab it into the same aperture again, taking in the feeling of his sternum cracking and shifting to make way for me to pierce through his organs. It comes flying out of my hand and into the hallway with a yank.</p>
   <p>I step away, looking at my blood-covered hands. A smile paints itself across my face but soon wipes off with tears as I stomach the horrific crime I committed.</p>
   <p>“So that’s whatcha’ wanted?” Coroz jokes with a wheeze. “It’s not like I’m goin’ anywhere. Ya’ just here to watch me die? Spoiler alert. It don’t matter. I got bigger plans beyond here. I’m jus’ surprised!” He coughs and gasps for a bit. A cackle hides under his breath, progressively growing louder and louder until it becomes maniacal. “Ya’ lost ya’ mind, sweetie! Join the club!” With a delighted scream, he laughs, “Malva and I welcome ya’ with open arms!”</p>
   <p>With a jump, I back away from him. I’m nothing like those two. I know I’m not!</p>
   <p>Coroz giggles, “Like it or not, ya’ got more in common with Malva than your little friend Lily.”</p>
   <p>Shut up.</p>
   <p>“Ya’ both just use people for what cha’ need or throw them away, don’t cha’? I mean, that’s what cha’ shown me in the little bit of time I’ve gotten to know ya.’”</p>
   <p>His words lay heavy, speaking the truth I didn’t want to hear. The way Lily looked at me in that elevator, how I was ready to kill her if Malva came back. I was prepared to kill anyone in that elevator ride to the monitor room. This can’t be the truth. I’m far from being like Malva, aren’t I? My blood-covered hands quiver with the answer.</p>
   <p>“Well, it don't matter now. I said it once, and I’ll say it again: ya played me, Jada. But ya’ haven’t won this game just yet.” Coroz stretches his smile uncomfortably wide.</p>
   <p>“Connection complete.” says a voice from the tester. My spine shivers with a pulse of electricity, making me scratch myself all over my body. Within a couple of seconds, the sensation goes away.</p>
   <p>“Trust me. I’ll be back to make ya’ suffer. Just not with these hands.” He laughs with pure insanity, his eyes closing as he begins to lose consciousness. He knows he’s about to die, yet he still mocks me by chuckling in my face. I can’t watch this clown anymore. I need to get out of here before I make another stupid decision. Slamming the door behind me, I leave that bastard to burn.</p>
   <p>I need to rush back to the elevator. This place is crumbling apart. Sliding around the lab, I’m trying to avoid the falling foundation and puddles of gasoline. The more I run, the more light-headed I get.</p>
   <p>Lily appears in the distance. She’s covering her mouth and nose with her shirt, waving for me to rush. My head becomes too light; the fumes are beginning to get to me. I stumble closer and closer, Lily’s yelling something, but everything is fading away. Sprinting into the flaming halls, she calls my name.</p>
   <p>Suddenly, Lily runs into the hall, wrapping her arm around me to hold me up for the last couple of feet. “We need to go, Jada!” she yells, “We are almost there!” The elevator doors open, bright as heaven’s gate. My feet drag across the ground, burning the rest of the energy my aching body can give. The blood dripping from her cuts runs all along her arm; they smear onto me. Despite my attempts to pull her off so she could get out, Lily won’t let go of me for anything. “Come on! Stay with me!”</p>
   <p>Imelda appears again in the corner of my eye, running next to the two of us. She jumps in excitement, giving me enough strength to keep going. I’m so close. We’re so close. It’s time to go home.</p>
   <p>We finally stumble into the elevator, and Lily smashes the button for the first floor. I collapse to the floor, Lily going down with me. “We made it!” she cheers, tears streaming down her face. My torn muscles pinch every nerve down my spine as I let out a wheeze of pain. “Oh sorry, dear! Are you alright?” She asks, examining my back. I ignore the pain and join her laughter.</p>
   <p>I give her a gentle smile and rest myself under her bleeding arm. Wait a minute, why is it covered in blood? It soaks the back of my neck, dripping down my shirt.</p>
   <p>“What happened to your arm?” I sign. A drop of blood drips onto my forehead; I track it back to see a shattered lightbulb hanging above me.</p>
   <p>I notice the glass shard in her opposite hand cutting her as she keeps a tight grip on it. “I was doing alright, holding Ellie down while moving around. Once you left and I was alone with her, this was the only way I could keep her at bay.” All across her arm, there are gashing cuts that pour blood. Some of them would need stitches to heal; she got dangerously close to her wrist. I try to remove her coat to cover the wounds, but she lightly grips my hand and smiles. “Don’t worry about me. The authorities will help when we get there.”</p>
   <p>I lay my head on her shoulder. All my energy drains from me; I can fall asleep on her skeletal arm. The screams still ring in my ears, and every time I try to close my eyes, I can see Annie’s innocent eyes staring right back at me through the wreckage. I lost the child, but Imelda says it wasn’t my fault. Maybe she’s right. I wasn’t the one who brought her here in the first place. I didn’t choose to kill Annie or Malva; there was one person I decided to kill. The guilt of stabbing Coroz with the scissors and leaving him to die settles in my stomach like a rock. Imelda was right. It seemed like a good idea before I executed it, but now the dread of his blood on my hands looms over me. I don’t think that was the right decision.</p>
   <p>He couldn’t have survived. There was no possible way. Should I be glad that he couldn’t have survived? Probably not. I’m not.</p>
   <p>I look to my side, and Imelda sits in the corner of my eye. Her beaming smile makes me laugh, putting a light crooked smile on my face. She’s upset that I was reckless in my last moments down there, but the excitement of getting out overshadows it.</p>
   <p>The presence of Coroz breathing down my neck suddenly develops, cheerfully laughing in my ear. In the corner of my eye, he sits beside me, staring at me with an unnaturally stretched smile. I jolt around, screaming and kicking to get away from him. No, it can’t be.</p>
   <p>“Are you alright, dear?” Lily questions.</p>
   <p>He transferred into my chip. He transferred into my chip! Imelda! I don’t have a tester on me. I left it in the apartment. It’s ok. We can figure this out when I get out. I just hope that Imelda can deal with him until I get there.</p>
   <p>For now, I only want to think about going home. I haven’t seen the bright sky in ages, the feeling of fresh air sweeping through my lungs. The idea of cooking with my papa. My mama and I baking together some not-so-well-done cookies and being able to hear my sister laugh about a dumb joke. I think of home and being alive. That’s all I want right now.</p>
   <p>The elevator stops, quavering as it struggles to keep going. Our compact chamber echoes throughout with the sound of cables snapping, and slamming against the roof; the elevator free-falls one foot for every two feet it lifts us. Lily and I look at the monitor reading "floor four." We are nowhere near close to the surface.</p>
   <p>"Jada, stay down!” Lily commands. “This elevator's not going to make it!" She looks into the screen in, not shock, but disappointment.</p>
   <p>I thought we were going home. Stupid for me to think this story would have a happily ever after. Lily squeezes my hand with all her might and whispers, “I’m sorry.”</p>
   <p>I think this is our ending. We tried to save as many people as possible but forgot about ourselves. At least Lily is here with me at the end of the day. I couldn’t have made it this far without her protecting me against Malva. And Imelda stayed with me until the end of the line; maybe that’s why we lasted this long. We looked out for each other. I carried her consciousness, and she showed me the way. Now, there’s nothing left to do except hold onto each other and hope for the best.</p>
   <p>The elevator gives in, and we enter a free fall. It gets faster and faster the more we plunge, our aching heads vibrating against the wall. We dive for a few seconds, but the drop feels like hours. In an instant, Lily arches her tiny body over me, grabbing my neck and tucking my head into her stomach.</p>
   <p>Boom!</p>
   <p>A thundering crack blares through my skull and bounces out of my ears. I’m barely conscious but can’t move or open my eyes. Lily’s warm body presses down onto me. I can’t tell if she’s breathing or not. Is she dead? Her body crushes under the rubble of the broken elevator, taking the weight off of my body. I suppose it’s a matter of time before I get crushed too or suffocate under the weight; I’m just waiting for the rest of my senses to slip away. I didn’t want to go. I was so close. We were so close, but there was nothing left to do. At least it doesn't hurt as bad as getting shot or cut. Being left alone with my last thoughts for a couple of minutes and waiting for the pain to end isn’t the worst ending I could have. I’m okay with this. This is the end of our story.</p>
   <p>“Hey! We have more survivors!”</p>
   <p>The voices of strangers echo in the stuffy chamber; the sound of clunky metal rubble being removed is slipping away from my ears. Did someone find us? Lily’s body gets lifted from my crushed spine.</p>
   <p>“We’ve got you….”</p>
   <p>Everything is fading away, and the arms of a stranger pick me up. The intense light from their flashlights fights its way through my eyelids. Multiple voices mumble around my head as my body gets flipped around to be cradled in angelic arms. I can’t hold on any longer. I want to be alive again.</p>
   <p>“Stay with us...stay with….”</p>
