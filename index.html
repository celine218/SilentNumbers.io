        Dr. Lilywise and Dr. Malva are on a mission to revolutionize the future of warfare through Project W.H.I.P: Weaponized Human Interpolation Program. In the depths of their facility, Dr. Malva begins to lose her mind in search of a successful candidate. Kidnappings, murders, and betrayal are all done in the name of science. While their story is crucial to this tale, it does not revolve around them. All that is known about the downfall of this facility can be found through fragments of Dr. Lilywise's audio logs at the beginning of each chapter. The logs date back to August 2035 and lead up to December 2039.

        This story follows the perspective of Jada Juarez, a 21-year-old college student, who fell victim to the facility’s kidnappings on a cold December night in 2039. Held in a cell hundreds of feet underground, she finds herself being tortured by the doctors’ tests with the rest of the victims. Upon her arrival, the initial surgery performed on her leaves her bewildered. The procedure fills her mind with memories and information about the facility that don’t seem to belong to her; as well as thoughts that are not her own. Things take a turn for the worse when Dr. Lilywise, her only ally, suddenly disappears. With tensions rising in the facility, Jada puts her life on the line and plans an escape from this hellish imprisonment. Will she trust the right people along the way? Or will she succumb to Dr. Malva’s experiments?
